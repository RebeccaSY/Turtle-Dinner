In this game, players take control of a turtle's movement using an ultrasonic sensor, guiding it through the ocean to feed on jellyfish. However, the ocean is also littered with plastic bags that look similar to jellyfish, posing a threat to the turtle's health. It is important to avoid these plastic bags as they are harmful to the turtle's survival.

Eating jellyfish increases the turtle's health, while mistakenly colliding with plastic bags decreases its health. Failure to avoid an excessive number of plastic bags compared to the jellyfish eaten will lead to a failure of survival. As the game progresses, day and night cycles alternate. The plastic bags accumulate, with an increase in the turtle's movement speed, will result in a growing challenge.

This game aims to demonstrate the impact of plastic pollution on marine life. The player can see the pollution under a sea creature's eyes, understanding the need for sustainable practices to preserve our environment.
